# Google-Android-Developer-Training-Course
This is my personal run-through of Google's Android Developer Basic Training Course. 
https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course
I am doing this course to learn Kotlin's features and Android app development, after completing a college degree mainly focusing on Java desktop app development.
